# Back End Ecommerce

## Description
In this challenge I created GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes for an e-commerce back end application. Using models to define the datatypes of each data entry into the database. The relationship between data was very important to ensure the database works properly when updating or deleting a certain tag, product or category.

## Usage
Users can do an npm intall to intall all the required dependencies. Once installed type npm start into the command line in the terminal to start the local server. Then you can use HTTPie to test the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes.
